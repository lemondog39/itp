#Haiku Assignment

## What I did
   - Created an .aiff file of my computer reciting Shel Silverstein's poem "The Wild Cherote"
   - Saved and located the file in my computer's Documents folder

## How I did it
   - I looked up "short poems shel silverstein" on Google
   - The first website that showed up was [21 Short and Sweet Shel Silverstein Poems That'll Bring You Back To Childhood](https://www.harpercollins.com/blogs/harperkids/shel-silverstein-poems), from HarperCollins
   - Scrolled down to number 7, which was titled "The Wild Cherote"
   - Opened Terminal on my Mac
   - Typed "pwd" to check my location, which at this point was just said /Users/christiechong
   - Typed "cd documents" to change my location to my Mac's Documents folder
   - Typed "say -v "Samantha" "I'd like a coat of Wild Cherote. It's warm and fleecy as can be. But note: What if the Wild Cherote would like a coat of me?" -o TheWildCherote.aiff" to create the file of my computer reciting the poem, and pressed enter
   - Typed "ls" to check the contents of my Documents folder and check if the .aiff file was saved correctly (it was).
