#  JavaScript Reading!

### Chapter 1: Values, Types and Operators
  
- 1 thing I didn't know
  - 98% of this chapter was new information to me, but one of the things I didn't know before was that JavaScript uses fixed 64 bits to store a single numerical value to represent a number, and therefore up to 9 quadrillion numbers (and not 18 quintillion due to nonwhole numbers involving decimals). 
  - It was also interesting to read about how to format strings, and the notation used (e.g. using backtick and slashes to create newlines).
  
- 1 thing I knew
  - I already knew how binary works and to write numbers in bits (e.g. 13 being written as 00001101), especially since it was explained on the first day of class.
  
  
### Chapter 2: Program Structure

- 1 thing I didn't know
  - I didn't know about bindings, and how they are used to help the computer remember things (in JavaScript) by assigning names to values. I liked the analogy of bindings being like tentacles - that it can hold onto multiple values, and "grows" a tentacle whenever a new value is assigned to it. This is a random thought I had while reading this section, but the use of the keyword "let" to create bindings reminds me of algebra, like "let x = 2, y = 3" situation. For example: 
  
```let two = 2, three = 3;```

```console.log(two * three);```

```// → 6 ```

Like let x = 2, y = 3, xy = 6 (Or maybe it doesn't make sense.) 

- 1 thing I knew
  - Honestly there was nothing in this chapter I knew about beforehand, so I'll just write another thing I found interesting in this chapter. I liked the section about conditional execution, because it reminded me of branching in video games, like picking different dialogue choices leading to different responses and outcomes from the game. 
  - This is fun to think about, like how a program can be viewed as a video game (of course all video games are some type of program), but for example, some games only give you a good ending if you've made very specific choices throughout the course of the entire game. 
  
### Chapter 3: Functions 
 
- 1 thing I didn't know
 - I didn't know about how functions worked in JavaScript and the numerous kinds of notations used just regarding writing a function. I feel like even after reading the chapter, it's difficult for me to understand how a function works in a program. 
 
- 1 thing I knew
 - From the previous chapter I know what a binding is and how to declare one, though this chapter addresses scopes in bindings, which I didn't know about. It was a bit hard to wrap my mind around the whole "local" and "global" concept of bindings and their scopes.
